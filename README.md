Ludo Game project is written in Python.
The project file contains python scripts 
(game.py, run.py, painter.py, recorder.py).
This is a simple console based strategy
board game which is very easy to understand
and use. Talking about the gameplay, all the
playing rules are the same just like we play
in real time ludo. Here at first, the user has
to select players i.e either human or computer.
After selecting human, the player has to enter
details such as name and select color
(red, green, yellow and blue). the player can
also start the game within two players if
he/she wants.
